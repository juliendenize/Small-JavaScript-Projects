# Small JavaScript Projects

In this repository I store the project I developped via the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-the-complete-course-build-10-projects/ .

### LocalStorageForm
In this project I developped the app.js script, the other resources were given. The idea is to have one webpage where we can add and remove tweets which are displayed as a list.

To add tweets you click on the add button which doesn't submit the form and store the tweet in the local storage and display it. To remove a tweet you click on the red cross which appear next to the corresponding tweet.

### Shoppingcart
A project similar to to the first one. You fill a shopping cart with courses and can remove items or clear the shopping cart. It is also using the local storage.

### Email
A project which consists in validating a form via Javascript. There is a submit button enabled only when all the fields are valids. Also a reset button makes it easy for the user to reset te form.

### Insurance
In this project you fill an insurance form and you get a result based on the data you passed.

There are two scripts that I wrote:
- `js/app.js` which works with old objects with prototypes.
- `js/appClassesES6.js` which works with ES6 classes.
