# Small JavaScript Projects

In this repository I store the project I developped via the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-the-complete-course-build-10-projects/ .

## LocalStorageForm
In this project I developped the app.js script, the other resources where given.

The idea is to have one webpage where we can add and remove tweets which are displayed as a list.

To add tweets you click on the add button which doesn't submit the form and store the tweet in the local storage and display it. 

To remove a tweet you click on the red cross which appear next to the corresponding tweet.
